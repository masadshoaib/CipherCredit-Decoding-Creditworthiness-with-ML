# Machine Learning for Credit Card Application Review

## Dataset

- Project dataset consists of application_record.csv and credit_record.csv, mergeable via
the client number (ID).
  a. application_record.csv includes personal/financial info (gender, car ownership, income,
etc.): 17 columns and ~440,000 rows
  b. credit_record.csv tracks monthly credit history, overdue days, and payments: 3 columns
and ~1,000,000 rows
- Found during research on credit scoring and finance machine learning on Kaggle.

## Data Preparation
-   De-duplication
-   Dealing with Sparse Columns
-   Handling Outliers
-   Imputing Missing Values using MICE
-   Balancing dataset using SMOTE
